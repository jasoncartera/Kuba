# portfolio-project

Python implementation of the board game called Kuba. You can see the rules [here](https://sites.google.com/site/boardandpieces/list-of-games/kuba).
A good video resource to watch this game rules is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XglqkfzsXYc).

This is an extension of the portfolio project for CS162 at Oregon State University. I added a graphic interface using PyGame. Black or white can start first. This version randomly chooses the starting player.

The code for the graphics is avalaible, and I will release the game logic after the end of term. Here is a short video:
