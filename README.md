# portfolio-project

Python implementation of the board game called Kuba. You can see the rules [here](https://sites.google.com/site/boardandpieces/list-of-games/kuba).
A good video resource to watch this game rules is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XglqkfzsXYc).

This is an extension of the portfolio project for CS162 at Oregon State University. The game engine with a console-based interface was required for the assignment. I added a graphic interface using Pygame to supplement the project and provide an easier way to play. Black or white can start first. This version randomly chooses the starting player.

The code for the graphics is avalaible, and I will release the game engine after the end of term. Here is a short video:
